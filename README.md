# DevOps-Project-Terraform-Jenkins-AWS-REST-API-Deployment
This project demonstrates the setup of a DevOps environment using Terraform, Jenkins, and AWS to deploy a REST-based web application built with Python Flask and MySQL on an RDS instance.

Overview:
This project demonstrates the setup of a DevOps environment using Terraform, Jenkins, and AWS to deploy a REST-based web application built with Python Flask and MySQL on an RDS instance.

Tools and Technologies:
Terraform: Infrastructure provisioning and management.
Jenkins: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
AWS: Cloud services including Route 53, VPC, Application Load Balancer, RDS, etc.
Python Flask: Framework for building REST APIs.
MySQL: Database management system for storing application data.
Project Structure:
Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
Terraform scripts for creating AWS resources (VPC, subnets, etc.).
CI/CD Pipeline:
Jenkins pipelines for automating build, test, and deployment processes.
Python Flask Application:
Codebase for the REST API application.
MySQL Database:
Scripts and configurations for managing the database.
Documentation:
README file, setup instructions, and project overview.
Steps to Deploy:
Setting Up Infrastructure:

Use Terraform to create VPC, subnets, internet gateway, route tables, etc.
Ensure proper segregation of resources in public and private subnets.
Configuring Jenkins:

Install Jenkins on an EC2 instance using Terraform.
Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate deployment workflows.
Deploying Python Flask Application:

Build and package the Flask application.
Deploy the application on EC2 instances managed by Jenkins.
Managing MySQL Database:

Set up an RDS instance for MySQL.
Configure database access and security groups.
DNS Management and Load Balancing:

Use Route 53 for domain management and DNS routing.
Set up an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic to EC2 instances.
SSL/TLS Certificate:

Secure communication with SSL/TLS certificates using AWS Certificate Manager.
Monitoring and Scaling:

Implement monitoring and logging using AWS CloudWatch.
Scale resources based on demand using Terraform's scalability features.
Usage:
Clone the GitHub repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Set up AWS credentials and configure Terraform:

csharp
Copy code
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
Configure Jenkins pipelines for CI/CD:

Set up Jenkins job to fetch code from GitHub and trigger build and deployment.
Access the REST API:

Use the custom domain configured with Route 53 to access the deployed application.
Additional Notes:
Ensure AWS credentials are stored securely and not exposed in the codebase.
Follow best practices for security, scalability, and performance optimization.
Regularly update and maintain infrastructure and application components.
